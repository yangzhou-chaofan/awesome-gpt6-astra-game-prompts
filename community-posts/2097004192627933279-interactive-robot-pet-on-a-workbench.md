## Prompt

```text
THE FULL SPEC.
SAVE IT AS A FILE IN THE PROJECT FOLDER, NOT AS A CHAT MESSAGE.
THEN: /goal build this in three.js, read SPEC.md and follow it
exactly, especially sections 9 and 10.

{ START }

1 WHAT THIS IS

a small four-legged robot lives on a workbench. you charge it,
play with it, and give it three jobs. it never leaves the bench
and neither do you. that is the whole game.

two things carry this build and nothing else does: how the robot
looks, and how it moves. the player spends the entire game
looking at one object from a fixed distance, so that object has
to be worth looking at, and it has to move like it is alive.

it is not a talking pet. no voice, no mouth, no face on a screen,
and it never repeats what you say. it is a machine that pays
attention to you, which is a different and better thing.

2 THE ROBOT

about the size of a cat, on four legs.

proportion, which is where charm comes from:
- the body is a rounded block, wider than tall, about two head
  widths long. it reads heavy.
- the head is large for the body, roughly 40 per cent of body
  height, and sits forward on a short neck. it reads curious.
  not a chibi head, and the eyes are not big.
- the legs are slender next to that body, so a heavy thing is
  carried on light limbs. that contrast is what makes the walk
  look delicate rather than clumsy.
- a stub tail that is really a counterweight, and swings like one
- one short antenna on the head that whips and settles half a
  beat behind every movement. costs almost nothing, and it is the
  single biggest source of life in the whole model.

three materials, no more than three:
1 painted panel, soft bone white, matte, slightly warm. over the
  back, the haunches and the top of the head. at least 60 per
  cent of the visible surface or it reads as a pile of parts.
2 bare machined metal, cool mid grey, on legs, frame, joints and
  neck. warm brass at each joint ring only.
3 dark rubber, near black and matte, on the four feet, the neck
  sleeve and the cable.

the face: two round lenses of equal size, set wide, recessed
behind a machined groove across the brow. the groove is a
machined edge, not an eyebrow, and it never moves. all expression
comes from head angle, antenna and lens brightness.

one flaw: one shoulder panel is a slightly different shade, as
though replaced once. nothing draws attention to it.

silhouette test, pass or fail: render the robot pure black on
white at 64 by 64 pixels, from the side and three quarters. the
raised head, the gap between head and body, four legs with
daylight between them, and the tail must all still read. if any
two masses merge, change the model, not the render.

3 THE BATTERY IS THE PROGRESS BAR

a strip of five cells runs along one flank, lit amber. they go
out one at a time as it runs down and light one at a time as it
charges. nothing on screen shows a number or a bar.

5 cells  brisk, head up, tail swinging
4        normal
3        slower, head slightly lower
2        it sits down between actions instead of standing
1        it walks to the charging pad on its own and waits
0        it folds its legs and powers down where it stands,
         lenses dark, waiting to be carried to the pad

it never breaks, never dies, and nothing is lost at zero.

4 HOW IT MOVES

- a real walk. diagonal pairs, feet planted on the bench and
  staying there while the body passes over them. feet do not
  slide.
- weight. the body dips on the loaded pair. starting, it leans
  forward before it moves. stopping, it takes one short step to
  catch itself.
- it watches you. the head follows the cursor whenever the cursor
  is over the bench, and the neck leads the turn before the body.
- it recovers. nudge it and it staggers, plants a leg wide, and
  rights itself. it never falls over.
- it settles. standing still it shifts weight every few seconds,
  and the lenses do a slow blink: they dim and come back, they do
  not close.

it gets better with practice. every job done makes the wobble a
little smaller and the movement a little faster, up to a limit.
nothing announces this. by the twentieth job it visibly moves
like a machine that knows what it is doing, and that change is
the only progression in the game.

5 THE BENCH

one workbench, seen from a fixed distance. warm, worked in.

bench top worn pale timber. wall behind cool grey green, plain.
robot bare metal with warm brass at the joints. lenses and cells
amber, the only lit colour. lamp light warm, from one side,
casting a long soft shadow. everything else muted.

on the bench: a charging pad with a coil of cable, a jar of
bolts, a rolled cloth, a small crate, a desk lamp, a rubber ball,
a tin bowl. nothing else.

the lamp is the only light source. when the robot crosses in
front of it, its shadow sweeps across the bench.

6 DESCRIBED ONLY THROUGH USES

- you drag the ball across the bench and the robot's head tracks
  it before its body turns to follow
- you put the robot on the charging pad and one cell lights, then
  the next, with a pause between each
- you nudge it from the side and it staggers, catches itself on a
  wide leg, and straightens
- you drop a bolt in the tin bowl and it walks over, picks it up
  in its mouth plates, and carries it to the jar
- you leave it alone and it walks to the edge of the bench, looks
  over, and backs away
- you scratch the panel on its back and it lowers its body and
  holds still until you stop

show all of this happening. never explain it in a caption.

7 THE THREE JOBS

each exists to show a different kind of motion, and each is asked
for by putting an object on the bench, never by a menu.

fetch  drop a bolt anywhere. it walks over, picks it up, takes it
       to the jar. shows the walk and the turn.
stack  put three crates out. it pushes them into a stack, one at
       a time. shows the push, the brace and the lift.
chase  roll the ball. it runs it down, stops it with a foot, and
       brings it back. shows the run, the skid and the stop.

each job costs a little charge. a job done at 2 cells is slower
and wobblier than the same job at 5. no queue, no order, no
timer, no reward.

8 THE INTERFACE

bottom centre: a single prompt card when something is in reach,
naming the key or the drag and the action, which disappears when
it is not.

nothing else on screen. no battery bar, no happiness meter, no
hunger meter, no coins, no level, no experience, no stars, no
timer, no menu, no settings, no tutorial popup, no floating label
over the robot.

everything the player needs to know is on the robot's body.

camera: fixed on the bench, three quarters from the front and
slightly above. 40 degree vertical field of view. the robot fills
30 to 45 per cent of frame height at the centre of the bench.
each battery cell at least 8 pixels wide at 1080p. the whole
bench in frame at all times. drag to orbit through about 60
degrees and no further. the camera never leaves the bench and
never cuts.

9 BANNED, EACH ONE NAMED

the pet: no voice, no talking, no repeating what you say, no
microphone, no face on a screen, no mouth, no eyebrows, no
cartoon eyes with pupils, no hearts, no emoji, no speech bubble,
no name entry, no costume, no hats, no paint shop.

free-to-play: no coins, no gems, no currency of any kind, no
shop, no ads, no daily reward, no streak, no notification, no
energy that must be bought, no wait timer, no level, no
experience bar, no achievements, no leaderboard.

gameplay: no enemies, no combat, no health, no damage, no dying,
no breaking, no repair mini-game, no fail state, no score, no
timer, no quest markers, no cutscene, no loading screen art.

repeats of my earlier builds: no beach, no palm trees, no crabs,
no floating islands, no lanterns, no cherry blossom, no ninja, no
shuriken, no voxel blocks, no pickaxe, no lava, no car, no city,
no underwater, no kelp.

render: no realistic textures, no hard shadows, no lens flare, no
film grain, no letterboxing, no depth of field blur, no chromatic
aberration, no grey screen fog. bloom on the lenses and the
battery cells and nothing else.

10 THE BUILD BUDGET

this build must finish in one working session. everything below
is a hard no for this version. do not add it, do not stub it, do
not leave a todo for it.

no second room, no outdoors
no second robot
no saving or loading, a reload is a fresh robot
no physics engine: hand-written inverse kinematics for four legs
  on a flat plane, plus simple box collision on the bench props
no ragdoll
no sound
no menus, no settings, no pause screen
no more than three jobs
no day cycle

where the time must go, in this order:
1 the robot's proportions and the silhouette test
2 the walk cycle and the foot planting
3 the head tracking, the antenna and the settle
4 the battery states and the charging pad
5 the three jobs
6 the bench dressing

if time runs out, ship with an empty bench and a beautiful robot
that walks well. never the other way round. a bare bench with a
good robot is a finished game. a dressed bench with a stiff robot
is nothing.

before you call it done, prove these four with renders, not with
words: the silhouette test at 64 px from two angles, a walk cycle
at 5 cells and the same walk at 2 cells, the head tracking the
cursor across the full orbit, and the robot at 5 cells and at 0
cells side by side.

build it, then tell me the three things you would fix first.
